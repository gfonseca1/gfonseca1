ğŸ‘‹ Hi there!
My name is Guilherme and I'm a Data Analyst at bunq. I'm originally from Rio, Brazil, and I currently live in Amsterdam, NL. 
On this github I store my sideprojects.

ğŸ”­ Apart from working at bunq, I'm now creating my personal portfolio website and github.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), SQL, dbt and Looker (LookML).
